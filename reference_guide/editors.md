This section covers working with text in the IntelliJ Platform editor. 
It is presented in two major sections:
* [Editor basics tutorial](/tutorials/editor_basics.md)
  * Using the action system to access a caret placed in a document open in an editor.
  * Accessing position information about a caret in an editor: coordinate systems and offsets. 
  * Handling actions activated by keystroke events in the editor. 
* [Multiple carets](multiple_carets.md)
  * Working with multiple, independent, carets in one editor.
  * How multiple carets affect core functionality, editor actions, typing actions, and code insight actions.
