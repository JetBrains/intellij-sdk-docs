title: Facet
---

A facet represents certain configuration, specific for a particular framework/technology, associated with a module. 
A module can have multiple facets. E.g. Spring specific configuration is stored in a Spring facet.
For more information about facets see [Adding Support for Frameworks and Technologies](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-projects.html#add-support-for-frameworks-technologies) and the help page for the [Facets dialog](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/facets.html) in the IntelliJ IDEA Web Help.
