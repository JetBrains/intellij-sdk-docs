title: Custom UI Themes

Beginning with the 19.1 release, custom UI Themes are supported by IntelliJ IDEA.
Custom UI Themes give designers control of the appearance of built-in IntelliJ IDEA UI elements. 
[Creating a new UI element](/user_interface_components/user_interface_components.md) for a plugin is distinctly different than Custom UI Themes. 

This section discusses creating and customizing UI Themes:
* [Creating UI Themes](themes.md)
* [Customizing UI Themes](themes_customize.md)
