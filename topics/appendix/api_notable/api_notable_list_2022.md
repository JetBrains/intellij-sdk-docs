Display of previews for Intentions and Quick Fixes
: Intentions and Quick Fix actions now display a preview for the code changes. Read [this article](code_intentions_preview.md) to learn more about this feature.

Specify language for Intention
: Specify `<language>` in `com.intellij.intentionAction` EP registration to avoid instantiating language-specific intentions in non-relevant places.

"Heavy" Brace Matching
: Alternative extension point to implement [](additional_minor_features.md#brace-matching) in background thread.

Injection Text Formatting
: Delegation of formatting can be controlled using dedicated [extension point](language_injection.md#formatting).

Specifying Threading for Actions
: Implementations of `AnAction` need to override `getActionUpdateThread()` as detailed in [](basic_action_system.md#principal-implementation-overrides).

Threading assertions in tests
: All rules for [threading](threading_model.md) are now checked in tests as well.

Mapping New UI icons
: See [](icons.md#new-ui-icons) on how to provide additional icons.

### IntelliJ IDEA 2022.3

Unbundled plugins
: Several plugins (Haml, Jakarta EE: WebSockets, JBoss Seam, Spring WebSocket, Stylus, Tapestry, Vaadin, ZKM-Unscramble) have been unbundled.
