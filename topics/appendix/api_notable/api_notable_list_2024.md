Dumb-aware "Highlight Usages"
: [](additional_minor_features.md#semantic-highlight-usages) can be marked as [](indexing_and_psi_stubs.md#DumbAwareAPI).

`ParsingTestCase`: stable PSI check
: [`ParsingTestCase`](%gh-ic%/platform/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/ParsingTestCase.java) verifies that reparsing causes no changes (Parser bug).

Performance test classes and methods renamed to _Benchmark_
:
- [`PerformanceTestInfo`](%gh-ic-242%/platform/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/PerformanceTestInfo.java) has been renamed to [`BenchmarkTestInfo`](%gh-ic%/platform/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/BenchmarkTestInfo.java)
- [`PlatformTestUtil.newPerformanceTest*()`](%gh-ic-242%/platform/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/PlatformTestUtil.java) methods have been renamed to [`PlatformTestUtil.newBenchmark*()`](%gh-ic%/platform/testFramework/src/com/intellij/testFramework/PlatformTestUtil.java)

Testing: `Logger.error()` behaviour
: Does not throw during tests anymore, see [issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-453) for details.

### IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3

Unbundled _Swing UI Designer_ Plugin

Dumb-aware intentions and quick-fixes
: Mark implementations as enabled during indexing, see [](indexing_and_psi_stubs.md#DumbAwareAPI).

Workspace Model API

: Executed asynchronously now during tests, see [](testing_faq.md#how-to-handle-projectactivity).

Testing: indexes
: Indexes are now built asynchronously during tests, see [](testing_faq.md#how-to-handle-indexing).

`ToggleAction` in popups
: No longer closes popups, see [](basic_action_system.md#toggleActionPopupMenus)

### Kotlin Plugin

Depending on K1 API
: Plugins using K1 API classes must adjust their usages, see [Migrating Your IntelliJ IDEA Kotlin Plugin to K2 Mode](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2024/09/migrating-your-kotlin-plugin-to-k2-mode/).

### PyCharm 2024.2

Project setup

: Note change for [](psi_performance.md#projectRootManagerDependency).

Saving Settings on background thread
: Saving project/application [settings](settings.md) is no longer performed on [EDT](threading_model.md) to avoid freezes. [Issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-127/Save-project-application-settings-on-background-thread)

### IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1

Unbundled plugins
: Several plugins (Cucumber Groovy, Cucumber Java) have been unbundled. The IDE will suggest installation if the project contains related framework dependency. If your plugin depends on them, users will need to install them from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com).
