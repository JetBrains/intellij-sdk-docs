# Gradle IntelliJ Plugin – Usage Examples

<link-summary>Usage Examples of plugins using Gradle IntelliJ Plugin.</link-summary>

Marketplace platform provides the [IntelliJ Platform Explorer](https://jb.gg/ipe) – a search tool for browsing Extension Points inside existing implementations of open-source IntelliJ Platform plugins.
