# Coroutine Scopes

<link-summary>Explanation of coroutine scopes in the IntelliJ Platform.</link-summary>

Kotlin's coroutines follow the principle of structured concurrency.
It means that each coroutine is run in a specific [CoroutineScope](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-coroutine-scope/), which delimits the lifetime of the coroutine.
This ensures that they are not lost and do not leak.
An outer scope does not complete until all its child coroutines are completed.
Cancellation of the outer scope also cancels its child coroutines.
Structured concurrency ensures that any errors in the code are properly reported and never lost.

## IntelliJ Platform Scopes

IntelliJ Platform provides special coroutine scopes that help ensure proper structured concurrency of coroutines run from the platform or plugin code.
After cancellation, the platform awaits the completion of each scope.
Using correct parent scopes guarantees that child coroutines will be properly canceled when no longer needed, preventing resource leaks.

The following diagram presents the scopes and their parent-child relationships:

![intellij-platform-coroutines-scopes.svg](intellij-platform-coroutines-scopes.svg){width="644"}

All scopes presented on the diagram are [supervisor scopes](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/supervisor-scope.html) â€” they ignore the failures of their children.

Each coroutine scope can have only one actual parent, pointed with solid arrow lines.
Dashed arrow lines point to fictional parents, which follow the actual coroutine parent-child semantics:
- a parent scope cancels children on its own cancellation
- a parent scope awaits children before considering itself complete

The **Application x Plugin** and **Project x Plugin** are [intersection scopes](#intersection-scopes) with two semantic parents (actual and fictional).

### Main Scopes

- **Root** - the root scope spans all the coroutines.
  This is the standard root scope launched with [`runBlocking`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/run-blocking.html) coroutine builder.

- **Application** - a scope associated with the [`Application`'s](%gh-ic%/platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/application/Application.java) lifetime.
  It is canceled on application shutdown.
  This triggers cancellation of the **Application x Plugin** scope and, subsequently, its children, including the **Project x Plugin** scope.

- **Project** - a scope associated with a [`Project`'s](%gh-ic%/platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/project/Project.java) lifetime.
  It is canceled when a project is being closed.
  This triggers the cancellation of the **Project x Plugin** scope and, subsequently, its children.

- **Plugin** - a scope associated with a plugin lifetime.
  It is canceled on unloading of the corresponding plugin.
  This triggers cancellation of the **Application x Plugin** scope and, subsequently, its children, including the **Project x Plugin** scope.

### Intersection Scopes

- **Application x Plugin** - a scope which is an intersection of the **Application** and **Plugin** scopes.
  It is canceled when the application is shutdown or the corresponding plugin is unloaded.
  This triggers the cancellation of its children and the **Project x Plugin** scope and, subsequently, its children.
- **Project x Plugin** - a scope which is an intersection of the **Project** and **Plugin** scopes.
  It is canceled when a project is being closed or the corresponding plugin is unloaded.

Intersection scopes enable creating coroutines whose lifetime is limited by application/project and plugin lifetimes, e.g.,
application/project [services](plugin_services.md) provided by a plugin.

### Service Scopes

The **Application Service** and **Project Service** scopes are bound to an application and project [service](plugin_services.md) lifetimes accordingly.
They are children of the [](#intersection-scopes), which means that they are canceled when the application/project is closed or a plugin is unloaded.

The service scope is provided to services via constructor injection.
The following constructor signatures are supported:

- `MyService(CoroutineScope)` for application and project services
- `MyProjectService(Project, CoroutineScope)` for project services

The injected scopes' contexts contain [`Dispatchers.Default`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-dispatchers/-default.html) and [`CoroutineName(serviceClass)`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-coroutine-name/).

### EP Invocation Scopes
- **Application EP invocation** - TODO
- **Project EP invocation** - TODO

## Using a Correct Scope

### Use Service Scopes

If a plugin requires running some code in a coroutine, the recommended approach is to create a separate [service](plugin_services.md) that will receive its [own scope](#service-scopes) via constructor and launch the coroutine in this scope.
This approach guarantees the usage of the correct scope, preventing canceling wrong scopes and killing all their (e.g., application's or project's) coroutines accidentally:

```kotlin
@Service
class MyPluginService(private val cs: CoroutineScope) {

  fun shutdownService() {
    // this does not affect other services
    // in the same plugin/container:
    cs.cancel()
  }
}
```

See the [](launching-coroutines.md) section for details.

> The following sections describe the potential problems that would occur if the wrong coroutine scopes were used.
> This allows better understanding of the platform scopes and why the [service approach](#use-service-scopes) mentioned above should be used.

### Do Not Use Application/Project Scope

Application and Project scopes are exposed with `Application.getCoroutineScope()` and `Project.getCoroutineScope()`.
Never use these methods, as they are deprecated and will be removed in the future.

Using these scopes could easily lead to project or plugin class leaks, or accidental killing all their coroutines.

1. Project leak:
    ```kotlin
    application.coroutineScope.launch {
      project.getService(PsiDirectoryFactory::class.java)
    }
    ```
    Closing the project cancels its scope.
    The application scope remains active, and the project is leaked.

2. Plugin leak:
    ```kotlin
    project.coroutineScope.launch {
      project.getService(MyPluginService::class.java)
    }
    ```
    Unloading of the plugin cancels its scope.
    The project scope remains active, and the plugin classes are leaked.

3. Accidental cancellations:
    ```kotlin
    // kills all application coroutines:
    application.coroutineScope.cancel()
    // kills all project coroutines:
    project.coroutineScope.cancel()
    ```

### Do Not Use Intersection Scopes

There is no API for retrieving **Application x Plugin** and **Project x Plugin** [intersection scopes](#intersection-scopes),
but let's assume there is a method exposing the **Project x Plugin** scope:

```kotlin
/**
 * Returns the correct intersection scope for the project and plugin
 * by a given plugin class.
 */
fun Project.getCoroutineScope(pluginClass: Class<*>): CoroutineScope
```

Using this scope could lead to similar [problems as with the main scopes](#do-not-use-applicationproject-scope):

1. Plugin leak:
    ```kotlin
    project.getCoroutineScope(AnotherPluginService::class.java).launch {
      project.getService(MyPluginService::class.java)
    }
    ```
    Unloading of the plugin cancels its scope.
    The scope of another plugin remains active, and the plugin classes are leaked.

2. Accidental cancellations:
    ```kotlin
    // kills another plugin's coroutines:
    project.getCoroutineScope(AnotherPluginService::class.java).cancel()
    ```
