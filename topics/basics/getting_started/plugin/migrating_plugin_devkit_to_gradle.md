Converting a [DevKit-based](creating_devkit_theme_project.md) plugin project to a Gradle-based plugin project can be done using the New Project Wizard to create a Gradle-based project around the existing DevKit-based project:
* Ensure the directory containing the DevKit-based IntelliJ Platform plugin project can be fully recovered if necessary.
* Delete all the artifacts of the DevKit-based project:
    * <path>.idea</path> directory
    * <path>[modulename].iml</path> file
    * <path>out</path> directory
* Arrange the existing source files within the project directory in the Gradle [source set](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_project_layout) format.
* Use the New Project Wizard as though creating a [new Gradle project](gradle_prerequisites.md) from scratch.
* On the [New Project](gradle_prerequisites.md#create-ide-plugin) choose the <control>IDE Plugin</control> generator and set the values of:
    * <control>Group</control> to the existing package in the initial source set.
    * <control>Artifact</control> to the name of the existing plugin.
    * <control>Name</control> to the name of the directory where the existing plugin is located, e.g. if the plugin project base directory is <path>/Users/john/Projects/old_plugin</path>, it should be the <path>old_plugin</path>.
    * <control>Location</control> to the name of the plugin's parent directory, e.g. if the plugin project base directory is <path>/Users/john/Projects/old_plugin</path>, it should be the <path>/Users/john/Projects</path>.
* Click <control>Finish</control> to create the new Gradle-based plugin.
* [Add more modules](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_add_module) using Gradle [source sets](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#gradle_source_sets) as needed.
