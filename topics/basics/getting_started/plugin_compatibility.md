# Plugin Compatibility with IntelliJ Platform Products

<link-summary>Declaring and verifying compatibility of plugins developed for multiple IntelliJ Platform-based IDEs.</link-summary>

All products based on the IntelliJ Platform are built on the same underlying API.
Some of these products share features built on top of the platform, such as Java support in IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio.
Underlying those shared features are shared components.
When authoring a plugin for the IntelliJ Platform, it is important to understand and declare dependencies on these components.
Otherwise, it may not be possible to load or run the plugin in a product because the components on which it depends aren't available.

## Declaring Plugin Dependencies

For the purposes of dependencies, a _module_ can be thought of as a built-in plugin that ships as a non-removable part of a product.
A working definition of a dependency is that a plugin project cannot be run without the module present in an IntelliJ Platform-based product.
Declaring a dependency on a module also expresses a plugin's compatibility with a product in that the IntelliJ Platform determines whether a product contains the correct modules to support a plugin before loading it.

[](plugin_dependencies.md) describes the syntax for declaring plugin dependencies and optional plugin dependencies.
This document describes the IntelliJ Platform modules' functionality to aid in determining the dependencies of a plugin.

The way dependency declarations are handled by the IntelliJ Platform is determined by the contents of the <path>[plugin.xml](plugin_configuration_file.md)</path> file:
* If a plugin does not declare any dependencies in its <path>plugin.xml</path> file, or if it declares dependencies only on other plugins but not modules, it's assumed to be a legacy plugin and is loaded only in IntelliJ IDEA.
  This configuration of the dependency declaration is deprecated; do not use it for new plugin projects.
* If a plugin declares at least _one_ module dependency in its <path>plugin.xml</path> file, the plugin is loaded if an IntelliJ Platform-based product contains _all the modules and plugins_ on which the plugin has declared a dependency.

> Always verify declared dependencies work as expected, see [](#verifying-dependency).

## Modules

A _module_ represents a built-in plugin that is a non-removable part of a product.
Some modules are available in all products, and some modules are available only in some, or even just one product.
This section identifies and discusses modules of both types.

### Declaring Incompatibility with Module
<primary-label ref="2020.2"/>

A plugin can declare incompatibility with an arbitrary module by specifying [`<incompatible-with>`](plugin_configuration_file.md#idea-plugin__incompatible-with) containing module ID in its <path>plugin.xml</path>.

### Modules Available in All Products

A core set of modules is available in all standalone IDE products based on the IntelliJ Platform.
These modules provide a set of shared functionalities.
The following table lists modules that are currently available in all products.

> All plugins should declare a dependency on **`com.intellij.modules.platform`** to indicate dependence on shared functionality.

{style="note"}

| Module for [`<depends>`](plugin_configuration_file.md#idea-plugin__depends) Element | Functionality                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`com.intellij.modules.platform`**                                                 | Messaging, Themes, UI Components, Files, Documents, Actions, Components, Services, Extensions, Editors        |
| `com.intellij.modules.lang`                                                         | File Type, Lexer, Parser, Highlighting, References, Code Completion, Find, Rename, Formatter, Code Navigation |
| `com.intellij.modules.xml`                                                          | XML, XML DOM, XSD/DTD, DOM Model                                                                              |
| `com.intellij.modules.vcs`                                                          | VCS Revision Numbers, File Status, Change Lists, File History, Annotations                                    |
| `com.intellij.modules.xdebugger`                                                    | Debug Session, Stack Frames, Break Points, Source Positions, Memory Views, Tracked Instances                  |

As of this writing, if a plugin: **A)** is dependent _only_ on one or more of the modules in the table above, **and B)** declares those module dependencies in <path>plugin.xml</path>, then any product developed by JetBrains based on the IntelliJ Platform will load it.

### Modules Specific to Functionality

More specialized functionality is also delivered via modules and plugins in IntelliJ Platform-based products.
For example, the `com.intellij.modules.python` module supports the Python language-specific functionality.
If a plugin uses this module's functionality, such as Python-specific inspections and refactoring, it must declare a dependency on this module.

Note that not all products define and declare modules.
For example, PhpStorm does not have its own module, but the product itself depends on (and ships with) the PHP language plugin.
A plugin project is compatible with PHP functionality if it declares a dependency on this PHP language plugin.

The following table lists modules or built-in plugins that provide specific functionality, and the products currently shipping with them.
This table is not exhaustive, to see a list of all modules, invoke code completion inside `<depends>` element in the <path>plugin.xml</path> file.

#### Java

The [Java language functionality](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2019/06/java-functionality-extracted-as-a-plugin/) was extracted as a plugin in version 2019.2 of the IntelliJ Platform.
This refactoring separated the Java implementation from the other, non-language portions of the platform.
A dependency on the Java plugin (Plugin ID `com.intellij.java`) must be setup using [](plugin_dependencies.md).

#### AppCode/CLion
<primary-label ref="2020.3"/>

The [AppCode and CLion code was restructured](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2020/12/migration-guide-for-plugins-2020-3/) in version 2020.3.
This refactoring extracted some functionalities into specific modules for easier maintainability and reuse between AppCode/CLion and other JetBrains IDEs.
Consequently, [dependencies](plugin_dependencies.md) on [AppCode](app_code.md) and [CLion](clion.md) functionalities are expressed differently in <path>plugin.xml</path> depending on the version of the IDE being targeted:


<tabs>

<tab title="CLion">

* Syntax for 2020.3 and later releases:
  * <path>plugin.xml</path> (_allowable alternative_):

## Exploring Module and Plugin APIs

Once the [dependency on a module or plugin](plugin_dependencies.md) is declared in <path>plugin.xml</path>, it's useful to explore the packages and classes available in that dependency.
The section below gives some recommended procedures for discovering what's available in a module or plugin on which a project depends.
These procedures assume a project has the Gradle build script and <path>plugin.xml</path> dependencies configured correctly.

### Exploring APIs as a Consumer

Exploring the available packages and classes in a plugin or module utilizes features in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

If the project is not up-to-date, [reimport the Gradle project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-gradle-projects.html#gradle_refresh_project) as a first step.
Reimporting the project will automatically update the dependencies.

In the <control>Project</control> tool window, select <control>Project</control> View and scroll to the bottom to see [External Libraries](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/project-tool-window.html#content_pane).
Look for the library `Gradle:unzipped.com.jetbrains.plugins:foo:`, where "foo" matches, or is similar to the contents of the [`<depends>`](plugin_configuration_file.md#idea-plugin__depends)

### Exploring APIs as an Extender

If a project is dependent on a plugin or module, in some cases, the project can also [extend](plugin_extensions.md) the functionality available from the plugin or module.

> See [Explore the IntelliJ Platform API](explore_api.md) for more information and strategies.
> Dedicated Extension Point Lists specific to IDEs are available under _Product Specific_.
>

To browse the opportunities for an extension, start by placing the cursor on the contents of the [`<depends>`](plugin_configuration_file.md#idea-plugin__depends) elements in the project's <path>plugin.xml</path> file.
Use the [Go to Declaration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/navigating-through-the-source-code.html#go_to_declaration) IDE feature to navigate to the <path>plugin.xml</path> file for the plugin on which the project depends.

For example, performing this procedure on the `<depends>com.jetbrains.php</depends>` declaration in a project's <path>plugin.xml</path> file will navigate to the <path>plugin.xml</path> file for the `com.jetbrains.php` (PHP) project.
A common, but not universal, pattern in the IntelliJ Platform is for a plugin (like PHP) to declare [`<extensionPoints>`](plugin_configuration_file.md#idea-plugin__extensionPoints) and then implement each one as [`<extensions>`](plugin_configuration_file.md#idea-plugin__extensions).
Continuing the example, search the PHP plugin's <path>plugin.xml</path> file for:
* `<extensionPoints>` to find the opportunities for extending the PHP plugin's functionality.
* `<extensions defaultExtensionNs="com.jetbrains.php">` to find where the PHP plugin extends functionality.
  The extension namespace (in this example `com.jetbrains.php`) will match the [`<id>`](plugin_configuration_file.md#idea-plugin__id) defined in the <path>plugin.xml</path> file.

> If a dependency plugin [bundles its API sources](bundling_plugin_openapi_sources.md) in the distribution file, the Gradle IntelliJ Plugin (1.7.0+) will attach them to the plugin dependency in IDE, making sources available when navigating to the plugin API classes.

## Verifying Dependency

Before marking a plugin project as _dependent only on modules in a target product_ in addition to `com.intellij.modules.platform`, verify the plugin isn't implicitly dependent on any APIs that are specific to IntelliJ IDEA.

For [Gradle-based](developing_plugins.md) projects, [](verifying_plugin_compatibility.md#plugin-verifier) can be used to ensure compatibility with all specified target IDEs.

For DevKit-based projects, [create an SDK](setting_up_theme_environment.md#add-intellij-platform-plugin-sdk) pointing to an installation of the intended target IntelliJ Platform-based product, e.g., PhpStorm, rather than IntelliJ IDEA.
Use the same development version of the IntelliJ Platform as the targeted product.

Based on the tables above, the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/) automatically detects the JetBrains products with which a plugin is compatible, and makes the compatibility information available to plugin authors.
The compatibility information determines if plugins are available for users of a particular JetBrains product.

## Platform API Version Compatibility

The API of IntelliJ Platform and bundled plugins may change between releases.
The significant changes that may break plugins are listed on [Incompatible Changes in IntelliJ Platform and Plugins API](api_changes_list.md) page.
