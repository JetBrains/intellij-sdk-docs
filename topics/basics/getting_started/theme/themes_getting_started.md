This documentation section will help you get started with developing UI themes for the IntelliJ Platform-based IDEs.
You can use either [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) as your IDE (it is highly recommended to use the latest available version).
Both include the complete set of UI theme development tools.
To become more familiar with IntelliJ IDEA, please refer to the [IntelliJ IDEA Web Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/).

The recommended workflow for a UI Theme plugin is using Plugin DevKit approach, which is described in this section.
