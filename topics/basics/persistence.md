# Persistence Model

<link-summary>Introduction to the IntelliJ Platform Persistence Model.</link-summary>

The IntelliJ Platform Persistence Model is used to store a variety of information.
For example, [Run Configurations](run_configurations.md) and [Settings](settings.md) are stored using the Persistence Model.

There are two distinct approaches, depending on the type of data being persisted:
* [Persisting State of Components](persisting_state_of_components.md)
* [Persisting Sensitive Data](persisting_sensitive_data.md)
