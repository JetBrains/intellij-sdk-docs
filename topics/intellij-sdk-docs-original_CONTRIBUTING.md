# Contributing to the IntelliJ Platform SDK

This document describes our contribution guidelines for the open-source IntelliJ Platform SDK documentation and sample code.
Before you begin contributing content to the SDK, please read this page thoroughly as well as the [Code of Conduct](intellij-sdk-docs-original_CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [License](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-sdk-docs/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) documents.

For information about contributing to the IntelliJ Platform itself, please visit [](platform_contributions.md).

## Creating IntelliJ Platform SDK Content

Content contributions to the IntelliJ Platform SDK are very welcome!

Before creating content for a new topic or adding large sections to the existing pages, please create an issue in the [IJSDK YouTrack project](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=IJSDK&clearDraft=true&c=) to ensure we are not working on the same topic, and to agree on the form of the content draft.
Checking with us before starting the work will reduce the risk of creating content that is unnecessary and won't be accepted.

Please clone the _intellij-sdk-docs_ project from [GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-sdk-docs), make additions or changes, and submit a pull request.
Alternatively, start by clicking on the <control>Edit page</control> link on the top of each page.

Before creating or altering content, please consult these guides:

* [](sdk_style.md).
  This guide describes documentation conventions in terms of content style and syntax.
* [](sdk_code_guidelines.md).
  Conventions for code sample organization, project settings, and naming conventions are described in this document.
