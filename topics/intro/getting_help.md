## Problems with the Guide

If you're having problems with the guide itself, such as missing, incorrect, or confusing content, please [raise an issue on YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=IJSDK&clearDraft=true&c=).
If the problem is easily solved, you can also submit a [Pull Request](intellij-sdk-docs-original_CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you want to report (smaller) issues for a _specific_ page, you can also use <control>Was this page helpful</control> feedback form on the bottom of each page by providing more details after clicking the <control>No</control> button.
Please try to be as specific as possible and provide your e-mail address for further questions and getting notified of updates.

If you just want to share feedback on the guide, again, [raise an issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=IJSDK&clearDraft=true&c=), even if it's for a discussion, ideas on improvements or suggestions.

> Please don't use the **IJSDK** YouTrack project for plugin or [product support](#problems-with-products) requests - it's intended for the SDK and the documentation, and you'll get a better response using one of the methods below.

For questions and problems related to plugin development itself (rather than the content of this guide), you have several options:

* [#intellij-platform on JetBrains Platform Slack](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/slack/) - this chat room is a great place to ask questions about extending JetBrains products, with answers coming from both JetBrains team members and members of the community
* [Plugin Development Forum](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/200366979-IntelliJ-IDEA-Open-API-and-Plugin-Development) - post a message to the support forum.
  It is regularly updated with answers by JetBrains team members.

Of course, all raised questions will be used to try and improve this guide.

## Problems with Products

If you have a problem with an IntelliJ Platform-based product, such as IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, Rider, etc., please use any of the regular [Product Support](https://www.jetbrains.com/support/) channels.
