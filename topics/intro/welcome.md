Follow [JBPlatform](https://twitter.com/JBPlatform/) on Twitter and visit [JetBrains Platform Blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/) for the latest announcements.

Upgrading your plugin to the latest platform release? Make sure to check [Incompatible Changes](api_changes_list.md) as well as [Notable Changes and Features](api_notable.md).

Verify your plugin follows guidelines from [Dynamic Plugins](dynamic_plugins.md) to allow installing/updating without IDE restarts.
