<link-summary>Language Server Protocol (LSP) support in IntelliJ-based IDEs</link-summary>

The [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP) is an open-standard protocol developed by Microsoft. It enables communication between development tools and Language Servers.
Language Servers can provide language-specific features such as code completion, documentation, and formatting, which is far easier than implementing language support from scratch.
It also reduces the need for constant maintenance and tracking of changes in relevant languages and tools, making it easier to bring consistent language support to various development environments.

However, the canonical [](custom_language_support.md) provided by IntelliJ Platform still offers a wider range of integration with IDE features than handling and presenting data provided by a Language Server.
Therefore, the LSP approach shouldn't be considered as a replacement for the existing language API, but rather as an added value.

## Supported IDEs

<primary-label ref="2023.2"/>

The integration with the Language Server Protocol is created as an extension to the *paid* IntelliJ-based IDEs.
Therefore, plugins using Language Server integration are not available in Community releases of JetBrains products and Android Studio from Google.

The LSP API is publicly available as part of the IntelliJ Platform in the following IDEs:
IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm Professional, DataSpell, RubyMine, CLion, Aqua, DataGrip, GoLand, Rider, and RustRover.

## LSP Plugin Setup

The plugin must target [](idea_ultimate.md) version `2023.2` or later.

### Gradle Build Script

<tabs>
<tab title="IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin (2.x)">

Relevant <path>build.gradle.kts</path> configuration:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("org.jetbrains.intellij.platform") version "%intellij-platform-gradle-plugin-version%"
}

repositories {
  mavenCentral()

  intellijPlatform {
    defaultRepositories()
  }
}

dependencies {
  intellijPlatform {
    intellijIdeaUltimate("%ijPlatform%")
  }
}
```

</tab>

<tab title="Gradle IntelliJ Plugin (1.x)">

Upgrade the Gradle IntelliJ Plugin to the latest version.
It will attach the LSP API sources and code documentation to the project.

Relevant <path>build.gradle.kts</path> configuration:

```kotlin
plugins {
  // ...
  id("org.jetbrains.intellij") version "%gradle-intellij-plugin-version%"
}

intellij {
  version = "%ijPlatform%"
  type = "IU"
}
```

For projects based on the [](plugin_github_template.md), update the Gradle IntelliJ Plugin to the latest version,
and amend the values in <path>gradle.properties</path> accordingly.

</tab>
</tabs>

### plugin.xml

The <path>plugin.xml</path> configuration file must specify the dependency on the IntelliJ Platform _Ultimate_ module:

```xml

<idea-plugin>
  <!-- ... -->
  <depends>com.intellij.modules.ultimate</depends>
</idea-plugin>
```

### IDE Setup

Since 2024.2, LSP API sources are provided with the `IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate sources` artifact.
See [](tools_intellij_platform_gradle_plugin.md#attaching-sources-in-the-ide) on how to enable downloading sources.
Then, use <ui-path>Navigate | Class...</ui-path> to open the `LspServerManager` class.
In the opened editor, invoke <control>Download IntelliJ Platform sources</control> to download and attach sources.

#### Earlier IDE Versions

The LSP API sources are bundled in the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate distribution and can be found within the <path>\$IDEA_INSTALLATION\$/lib/src/src_lsp-openapi.zip</path> archive.

> Due to technical limitations in IDEs before 2024.1, it is necessary to manually attach sources to the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate dependency.
> To do so, when reviewing the compiled class which belongs to the LSP API, run the _Choose Sources..._ action, and point to the
> <path>\$IDEA_INSTALLATION\$/lib/src/src_lsp-openapi.zip</path> file.

## Basic Implementation

As a reference, check out the [Prisma ORM](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20686-prisma-orm) open-source plugin implementation: [Prisma ORM LSP](%gh-ij-plugins%/prisma/src/org/intellij/prisma/ide/lsp)

<procedure title="Minimal LSP Plugin Setup">

1. Implement `LspServerSupportProvider` and within the `LspServerSupportProvider.fileOpened()` method, spin up the relevant LSP server descriptor, which can decide if the given file is supported by using the `LspServerDescriptor.isSupportedFile()` check method.
2. [Register](plugin_extensions.md#declaring-extensions) it as a `com.intellij.platform.lsp.serverSupportProvider` [Extension Point (EP)](plugin_extension_points.md):
3. Tell how to start the server by implementing `LspServerDescriptor.createCommandLine()`.

```kotlin
import com.intellij.platform.lsp.api.LspServerSupportProvider
import com.intellij.platform.lsp.api.ProjectWideLspServerDescriptor

internal class FooLspServerSupportProvider : LspServerSupportProvider {
  override fun fileOpened(project: Project, file: VirtualFile, serverStarter: LspServerStarter) {
    if (file.extension == "foo") {
      serverStarter.ensureServerStarted(FooLspServerDescriptor(project))
    }
  }
}

private class FooLspServerDescriptor(project: Project) : ProjectWideLspServerDescriptor(project, "Foo") {
  override fun isSupportedFile(file: VirtualFile) = file.extension == "foo"
  override fun createCommandLine() = GeneralCommandLine("foo", "--stdio")
}
```

</procedure>

### Status Bar Integration

<primary-label ref="2024.1"/>

A dedicated <control>Language Services</control> status bar widget is available to monitor the status of all LSP servers.
Override `LspServerSupportProvider.createLspServerWidgetItem()` to provide a custom icon and link to [Settings](settings.md) page (if available).

```kotlin
override fun createLspServerWidgetItem(
  lspServer: LspServer,
  currentFile: VirtualFile?
) =
  LspServerWidgetItem(
    lspServer, currentFile,
    FooIcons.PluginIcon, FooConfigurable::class.java
  )
```

If there are configuration problems preventing from starting an LSP server, the plugin can provide a widget item
with an error and give the user a hint how to fix the problem.

## Language Server Integration

Language Server is a separate process that analyzes source code and provides language-specific features to development tools.
When creating a plugin that uses LSP within the IDE, there are two possibilities for providing a Language Server to end-users:

- Bundle a [Language Server implementation](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/servers/) binary as a resource delivered with a plugin.
- Provide a possibility for users to define the location of the Language Server binary in their environment.

The Prisma ORM plugin presents the first approach, which distributes the <path>prisma-language-server.js</path> script and uses a local Node.js interpreter to run it.

For more complex cases, the plugin may request to provide a detailed configuration with a dedicated [Settings](settings_guide.md) implementation.

## Customization

To fine-tune or disable the implementation of LSP-based features, plugins may override the corresponding properties of the `LspServerDescriptor` class.
See the [property documentation](#ide-setup) for more details.

### 2023.3

{id="customization_2023_3"}

- `lspFormattingSupport`
- `lspHoverSupport`

### 2023.2

{id="customization_2023_2"}

- `lspGoToDefinitionSupport`
- `lspCompletionSupport`
- `lspDiagnosticsSupport`
- `lspCodeActionsSupport`
- `lspCommandsSupport`

To handle custom (undocumented) requests and notifications from the LSP server, override `LspServerDescriptor.createLsp4jClient` property and the `Lsp4jClient` class according to their documentation.

To send custom (undocumented) requests and notifications to the LSP server, override `LspServerDescriptor.lsp4jServerClass` property and implement the `LspClientNotification` and/or `LspRequest` classes.
The documentation in the source code includes implementation examples.

See the [bundled LSP API source code](#ide-setup) and its documentation for more information.

## Troubleshooting

All the IDE and LSP server communication logs are passed to the IDE log file.

To include them, add the following entry to the <control>Help | Diagnostic Tools | Debug Log Settings…</control> configuration dialog:

```
#com.intellij.platform.lsp
```

For more information, see the [](ide_infrastructure.md#logging) section.

## Integration Overview

Integrating the Language Server Protocol (LSP) into a plugin for IntelliJ-based IDEs involves a trade-off between simple and fast language support and a complex custom language support plugin with IDE capabilities.

When considering the LSP-based approach, it is important to assess the following criteria for providing a Language Server to end users:

- OS dependency of the Language Server.
- Availability of the latest version online.
- Compatibility with breaking changes between versions.
- Feasibility of requesting the user to provide the Language Server binary path.

## Sample Plugins

The following open-source plugins make use of LSP:

- [Prisma ORM](%gh-ij-plugins%/prisma/src/org/intellij/prisma/ide/lsp)
