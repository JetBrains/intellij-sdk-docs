The _Go to Declaration or Usages_ action is performed in several steps.

## Direct Navigation

Direct navigation is the navigation from `PsiElement` to another `PsiElement`,
such as navigation from `break` keyword to the end of a loop in Java, without showing any popups.

To provide `PsiElement` for direct navigation, implement and register
[`DirectNavigationProvider`](upsource:///platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/navigation/DirectNavigationProvider.java).

## Symbol Navigation

If there is no Direct navigation available under the caret, then the IntelliJ Platform proceeds with `Symbol` navigation.
In this step the IntelliJ Platform computes the navigation targets based on target symbols,
which it obtains by resolving a [reference](declarations_and_references.md#references).
If there are several target symbols or several navigation targets defined for a symbol,
then the IDE shows the navigation popup to ask the user to choose where to go.

The [`NavigationTarget`](upsource:///platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/navigation/NavigationTarget.java)
is essentially a pair of a `Navigatable` and
a [`TargetPresentation`](upsource:///platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/navigation/TargetPresentation.kt)
instances (where to go and what to show in the popup).

To provide navigation targets by a `Symbol`, either:
- implement and register
  [`SymbolNavigationProvider`](upsource:///platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/navigation/SymbolNavigationProvider.java);
- or implement
  [`NavigatableSymbol`](upsource:///platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/navigation/NavigatableSymbol.java)
  in the `Symbol`.

## Showing Usages

If there are no navigation targets available, then the IntelliJ Platform starts finding usages of the target symbol
obtained by resolving a [reference](declarations_and_references.md#references)
or from a [declaration](declarations_and_references.md#declarations).
