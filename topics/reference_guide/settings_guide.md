<excerpt>Adding entries in Settings/Preferences.</excerpt>

_Settings_ persistently store states that control the behavior and appearance of IntelliJ Platform-based IDEs.
On this page, the term "Settings" means the same as "Preferences" on some platforms.

Plugins can create and store Settings to capture their configuration in a way that uses the IntelliJ Platform [Persistence Model](persisting_state_of_components.md).
The User Interface (UI) for these custom Settings can be added to the [IDE Settings dialog](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-preferences-dialog.html).

Settings can [affect different levels](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-project-and-ide-settings.html) of scope.
This document describes adding custom Settings at the Project and Application (or Global, IDE) levels.

## Extension Points for Settings

Custom Settings implementations are declared in the <path>[plugin.xml](plugin_configuration_file.md)</path> file using one of two extension points (EP), depending on the level of the Settings.
Many [attributes](#settings-declaration-attributes) are shared between the EP declarations.

Application and Project Settings typically provide an implementation based on the [`Configurable`](%gh-ic%/platform/ide-core/src/com/intellij/openapi/options/Configurable.java) interface because they do not have runtime dependencies.
See [Implementations for Settings Extension Points](#implementations-for-settings-extension-points) for more information.

> For performance reasons, it is recommended to declare as much information as possible about a 'Settings' implementation using attributes in the EP element in the <path>plugin.xml</path> descriptor.
> If it is not declared, the component must be loaded to retrieve it from the implementation, degrading UI responsiveness.

### Declaring Application Settings

The application-level settings are declared using `com.intellij.applicationConfigurable` EP.

An example `<applicationConfigurable>` EP declaration is shown below.
The declaration indicates the settings are a child of the `tools` settings group, the implementation FQN is `com.example.ApplicationSettingsConfigurable`, the unique ID is the same as the implementation fully qualified name (FQN), and the (non-localized) title displayed to users is "My Application Settings".
See [](#settings-declaration-attributes) for more information.

```xml
<extensions defaultExtensionNs="com.intellij">
  <applicationConfigurable
      parentId="tools"
      instance="com.example.ApplicationSettingsConfigurable"
      id="com.example.ApplicationSettingsConfigurable"
      displayName="My Application Settings"/>
</extensions>
```

### Declaring Project Settings

The project-level settings are declared using `com.intellij.projectConfigurable` EP.

An example `<projectConfigurable>` EP declaration is shown below.
Similar to the application setting example above, but it includes the additional attribute `nonDefaultProject` indicating these settings do not apply to the [default project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configure-project-settings.html#new-default-settings).
See [](#settings-declaration-attributes) for details.

```xml
<extensions defaultExtensionNs="com.intellij">
  <projectConfigurable
      parentId="tools"
      instance="com.example.ProjectSettingsConfigurable"
      id="com.example.ProjectSettingsConfigurable"
      displayName="My Project Settings"
      nonDefaultProject="true"/>
</extensions>
```

### Settings Declaration Attributes

Readers are encouraged to review the Javadoc comments for [`Configurable`](%gh-ic%/platform/ide-core/src/com/intellij/openapi/options/Configurable.java) because the attribute information applies to `ConfigurableProvider` as well as `Configurable`, as noted.
This section provides some additional clarification of those comments.

#### Table of Attributes

The attributes supported by `com.intellij.applicationConfigurable` EP and `com.intellij.projectConfigurable` EP are in the table below:

| `parentId`             | `Configurable`<br/>`ConfigurableProvider` |          Y           | This attribute is used to create a hierarchy of Settings. This component is declared one of the specified `parentId` component's children. Typically used for placing a Settings panel within the Settings Dialog menu. Acceptable values for `parentId` are given in [](#values-for-parent-id-attribute).<br/>`groupId` is deprecated.(3)                                                 |
| `groupWeight`          | `Configurable`<br/>`ConfigurableProvider` |          N           | Specifies the weight (stacking order) of this component within the group of a parent configurable component.

**Attribute Notes:**
1) Either `instance` or `provider` must be specified depending on the implementation.
2) One of these attribute sets must be specified depending on whether the displayed Settings name is localized.
3) If both `groupId` and `parentId` are specified, a warning is logged. Also, see _default_ entry in [](#values-for-parent-id-attribute).

#### Values for Parent ID Attribute

The table below shows the allowed values for the `parentId` attribute.
See the [previous section](#table-of-attributes) for all supported attributes.

| `parentId` Value | Group                        | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Implementations for Settings Extension Points

Implementations for `com.intellij.projectConfigurable` EP and `com.intellij.applicationConfigurable` EP can have one of two bases:
* The [`Configurable`](%gh-ic%/platform/ide-core/src/com/intellij/openapi/options/Configurable.java) interface, which provides a named configurable component with a Swing form.
  Most Settings providers are based on the `Configurable` interface or one of its sub- or supertypes.
* The [`ConfigurableProvider`](%gh-ic%/platform/ide-core/src/com/intellij/openapi/options/ConfigurableProvider.java) class, which can hide a configurable component from the Settings dialog based on runtime conditions.

### The Configurable Interface

Many Settings in the `intellij-community` code base implement `Configurable` or one of its subtypes, such as [`SearchableConfigurable`](%gh-ic%/platform/ide-core/src/com/intellij/openapi/options/SearchableConfigurable.java).
Readers are encouraged to review the Javadoc comments for `Configurable`.

#### Constructors

Implementations must meet several requirements for constructors.
* Application Settings implementations, declared using the [`applicationConfigurable` EP](#declaring-application-settings), must have a default constructor with no arguments.
* Project Settings implementations, declared using the [`projectConfigurable` EP](#declaring-project-settings), must declare a constructor with a single argument of type [`Project`](%gh-ic%/platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/project/Project.java).
* Beginning in 2020.2, constructor injection (other than for `Project`) is not allowed.

For a `Configurable` implementation correctly declared using an EP, the implementation's constructor is not invoked by the IntelliJ Platform until a user chooses the corresponding Settings `displayName` in the Settings Dialog menu.

> The IntelliJ Platform may instantiate a `Configurable` implementation on a background thread, so creating Swing components in a constructor can degrade UI responsiveness.
>
{type="warning"}

#### IntelliJ Platform Interactions with Configurable

The instantiation of a generic `Configurable` implementation is documented in the interface file.
A few high-level points are reviewed here:
* The `Configurable.reset()` method is invoked immediately after `Configurable.createComponent()`.
  Initialization of Setting values in the constructor or `createComponent()` is unnecessary.
* See the [](#constructors) section for information about when a Settings object is instantiated.
* Once instantiated, a `Configurable` instance's lifetime continues regardless of whether the implementation's Settings are changed, or the user chooses a different entry on the Settings Dialog menu.
* A `Configurable` instance's lifetime ends when <control>OK</control> or <control>Cancel</control> is selected in the Settings Dialog.
  An instance's `Configurable.disposeUIResources()` is called when the Settings Dialog is closing.

To open Settings dialog or show specific `Configurable`, see [`ShowSettingsUtil`](%gh-ic%/platform/platform-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/options/ShowSettingsUtil.java).

#### Configurable Marker Interfaces

Implementations based on `Configurable` can implement marker interfaces, which provide additional flexibility in the implementation.

The following nested interfaces are markers, which convey information about the form to the IntelliJ Platform:
* `Configurable.NoScroll` - Notifies the Settings dialog not to add scroll bars to the form.
  By default, a plugin's Settings component is put into a scrollable pane.
  However, a Settings panel can have a `JTree`, which requires its own `JScrollPane`.
  So `NoScroll` interface should be used to remove the outer `JScrollPane`.
* `Configurable.NoMargin` - Notifies the Settings dialog not to add an empty border to the form.
  By default, an empty border is added for a plugin's Settings component.

#### Additional Interfaces Based on Configurable

There are classes in the IntelliJ Platform specialized in particular types of Settings.
These subtypes are based on `com.intellij.openapi.options.ConfigurableEP`.
For example, <menupath>Settings/Preferences | Editor | General | Appearance</menupath> allows adding Settings via [`EditorSmartKeysConfigurableEP`](%gh-ic%/platform/lang-impl/src/com/intellij/application/options/editor/EditorSmartKeysConfigurableEP.java) and `com.intellij.editorSmartKeysConfigurable` EP.

#### Examples

Existing implementations of `Configurable` in the IntelliJ Platform that can serve as a reference are:
* [`ConsoleConfigurable`](%gh-ic%/platform/lang-impl/src/com/intellij/execution/console/ConsoleConfigurable.java) (application configurable)
* [`AutoImportOptionsConfigurable`](%gh-ic%/platform/lang-impl/src/com/intellij/application/options/editor/AutoImportOptionsConfigurable.kt) (project configurable)

### The ConfigurableProvider Class

The [`ConfigurableProvider`](%gh-ic%/platform/ide-core/src/com/intellij/openapi/options/ConfigurableProvider.java) class only provides a `Configurable` implementation if its runtime conditions are met.
The IntelliJ Platform first calls the `ConfigurableProvider.canCreateConfigurable()`, which evaluates runtime conditions to determine if Settings changes make sense in the current context.
If the Settings make sense to display, `canCreateConfigurable()` returns `true`.
In that case the IntelliJ Platform calls `ConfigurableProvider.createConfigurable()`, which returns the `Configurable` object for its Settings implementation.

By choosing not to provide a `Configuration` implementation in some circumstances, the `ConfigurableProvider` opts out of the Settings display and modification process.
The use of `ConfigurableProvider` as a basis for a Settings implementation is declared using [attributes](#table-of-attributes) in the EP declaration.

**Example**: [`RunToolbarSettingsConfigurableProvider`](%gh-ic%/platform/execution-impl/src/com/intellij/execution/runToolbar/RunToolbarSettingsConfigurableProvider.kt)
