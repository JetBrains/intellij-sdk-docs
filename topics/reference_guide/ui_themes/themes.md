Creating a custom UI Theme is a process of choosing a base IDE Theme (_Light_ or _Darcula_,) then changing aspects of the base Theme definition.
Custom UI Themes can:
* substitute icons,
* change the colors of icons and UI controls,
* alter the borders and insets of UI controls,
* provide custom editor schemes,
* add background images.

## The Structure of a UI Theme

UI Themes are components within IntelliJ Platform plugins.
The theme plugins should be stand-alone and not combined with other plugin functionality.
This approach provides the best user experience because it avoids an IDE restart when installing a UI Theme plugin.

UI Themes have several components:
* A required Theme description (JSON) file in the plugin project's <path>resources</path> folder.
* A required `themeProvider` declaration in the plugin's <path>[plugin.xml](plugin_configuration_file.md)</path> file, located in the plugin project's <path>META-INF</path> folder.
* An optional Editor Scheme description (XML) file derived from an exported IDE editor scheme.
  This file is located in the plugin project's <path>resources</path> folder.
* An optional background image file, located in the plugin project's <path>resources</path> folder.
* Optional icon image files, located in the plugin project's <path>resources</path> folder.

## Custom UI Theme Workflow

Creating a UI Theme follows this general sequence:
* [Setup Development Environment](setting_up_environment.md)
* [Start with a Plugin Project](creating_plugin_project.md)
* [Add UI Theme components to the plugin](#creating-a-ui-theme-with-the-devkit-theme-wizard) by using the DevKit UI Theme Wizard.
* [Customize the UI Theme](themes_customize.md) by adding data objects to the Theme description (JSON) file.
* [Add an Editor Scheme or Background Image](themes_extras.md) to the plugin.
* [Build and test](running_and_debugging_a_plugin.md) the UI Theme plugin.
* [Deploy the UI Theme plugin](deploying_plugin.md)
* [Publish the UI Theme plugin](publishing_plugin.md)

## Creating Custom UI Themes

A UI Theme is added to an IntelliJ Platform plugin using the DevKit UI Theme Wizard.

### Creating a UI Theme with the DevKit Theme Wizard

The DevKit Wizard is part of the DevKit plugin, which is bundled with IntelliJ IDEA.
This Wizard can be used for both DevKit-based and Gradle-based plugins.

While a plugin project is open in IntelliJ IDEA, select the <path>resources</path> folder in the _Project_ tool window.
From the main menu, select the <menupath>New | Plugin DevKit | Theme</menupath> action.

The Wizard then prompts for the name of the new Theme, and the basis for the Theme:

![DevKit Dialog](devkit_wiz_dialog.png)

The best practice is to name the new Theme the same as the name of the plugin.
The checkbox indicates the basis for the Theme.
Checking <control>Dark theme</control> means basing the custom Theme on _Darcula_.
Leaving the box unchecked means basing the custom Theme on the default IntelliJ IDEA _Light_ Theme.
For the SDK code sample `theme_basics` the box is _unchecked_.

Clicking the <control>OK</control> button creates a default Theme description file named <path>$THEME_NAME$.theme.json</path> in the plugin project's <path>resources</path> folder.
In this example, the file is named <path>theme_basics.theme.json</path>.
The content of the default file is a short set of keyâ€“value pairs:

```json
{
  "name": "theme_basics",
  "dark": false,
  "author": "",
  "editorScheme": "/theme_basics.xml",
  "ui": {
  }
}
```

The value of the `name` key matches the first portion of the Theme description <path>$THEME_NAME$.theme.json</path> file name.
The value of `name` is displayed in the [Theme](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-appearance.html)  _Preferences_ dropdown when the UI Theme's plugin is installed in the IDE.
The value of the `author` key is by default empty.
The `editorScheme` section will be addressed in [Adding a Custom Editor Scheme](themes_extras.md#adding-a-custom-editor-scheme)
The `ui` section will be addressed in [Customizing UI Control Colors](themes_customize.md#customizing-ui-controls).

The Wizard also creates a `themeProvider` declaration in the [`<extensions>`](plugin_configuration_file.md#idea-plugin__extensions) section of the plugin's <path>plugin.xml</path> file.
This declaration binds the Theme description file to a theme provider extension using a generated unique `id`.

```xml
<extensions defaultExtensionNs="com.intellij">
  <themeProvider
      id="eb9b7461-397b-4b98-a422-224fc0a74564"
      path="/theme_basics.theme.json"/>
</extensions>
```

> Do not modify or re-use an existing value of the generated `id` attribute.
>
{type="warning"}

At this point, the UI Theme `theme_basics` is a valid UI Theme.
Its plugin can be built and tested in IntelliJ Platform-based IDEs, giving the user the opportunity to select _theme_basics_ in the [Theme](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-appearance.html) _Preferences_ dropdown.
The custom Theme looks exactly like the IDE default `Light` Theme, but it is a valid custom Theme.

### Completing the Default UI Theme Description File

The default UI Theme definition can be directly edited to add or change some of the values for the default keys, if desired:
The following values can be changed directly in the Theme (<path>*.theme.json</path>) description file:
* The value of the `dark` key can be changed to `true`, which would switch the basis of the Theme to _Darcula_ instead of _Light_.
* The value of the `author` key, which defaults to an empty string, can be set to a `String` literal.

In the case of the `theme_basics` code sample, it is set to "IntelliJ Platform SDK".
