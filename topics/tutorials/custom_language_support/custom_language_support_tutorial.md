<excerpt>Tutorial for creating a .properties-like custom language.</excerpt>

In this tutorial we will add support for a [.properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) language and its usages within Java code.

> IntelliJ Platform support for custom languages is discussed in more depth in the [Custom Language Support](custom_language_support.md) section.
> Corresponding parts are linked under **Reference** on top of each page in this tutorial.

> All relevant code added or changed on a page is linked in **Code**.
>
> The accompanying [](writing_tests_for_plugins.md) tutorial covers testing the functionality; corresponding parts are linked under **Testing**.
