The [Gradle IntelliJ Plugin](tools_gradle_intellij_plugin.md) is the recommended solution for building IntelliJ Platform plugins.
The plugin takes care of the dependencies of your plugin project â€” both the base IDE and other [plugin dependencies](plugin_dependencies.md).
It provides tasks to run the IDE with your plugin and to package and [publish](deployment.md) your plugin to the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com).
To make sure that a plugin is not affected by [API changes](api_changes_list.md), which may happen between major releases of the platform, you can quickly verify your plugin against other IDEs and releases.

> [](github_template.md) makes it easier to create and maintain your IDE plugins, having the Gradle plugin already integrated and CI covered with GitHub Actions.

> If a new plugin will be Scala-based, a dedicated [SBT plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/sbt-idea-plugin) is available.
