*Live Templates* are customizable rules that allow developers to abbreviate repetitive text patterns or surround code fragments with repetitive constructs in the editor.

When a user types the designated abbreviation followed by a configurable *expansion key* (usually `Tab`), the IDE transforms the preceding input sequence to its full-length output, and update the cursor position.

For example, consider a `for` loop.
Typically, the end user would need to type `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {<Enter><Tab><Enter><Enter>}<Up>`.
This pattern may be shortened to `fori<Tab>` and the remaining contents will be expanded, leaving the following structure:

```java
for (int i = [|]; i < []; i++) {
  []
}
```

As the user completes each section of the `for` loop and presses `Tab`, the cursor advances to the next position in the editor.

Another use-case for live templates is surrounding the selected code with additional constructs.
When a user selects a code fragment and invokes the <ui-path>Code | Surround With...</ui-path> action and chooses the template from the list, the code is wrapped with the content defined in the template.

Consider the following Java method with the selected fragment:

```java
public void testMethod() {
  <selection>getActions()</selection>
}
```

Invoking the <ui-path>Code | Surround With...</ui-path> action and selecting the <control>Iterate Iterable or array</control> template would transform the code to:

```java
public void testMethod() {
  for (Action action : getActions()) {
    <cursor>
  }
}
```
