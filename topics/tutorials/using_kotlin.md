## Advantages of Developing a Plugin in Kotlin

Using Kotlin to write plugins for the IntelliJ Platform is very similar to writing plugins in Java.
Existing Java classes can be converted to their Kotlin equivalents by using the [J2K converter](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mixing-java-kotlin-intellij.html#converting-an-existing-java-file-to-kotlin-with-j2k) (part of Kotlin plugin).

In addition to [null safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/null-safety.html), [type-safe builders](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html), and [](kotlin_coroutines.md), the Kotlin language offers many convenient features for plugin development,
which make plugins easier to read and simpler to maintain.
Much like [Kotlin for Android](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/android-overview.html), the IntelliJ Platform makes extensive use of callbacks, which are straightforward to express as [lambdas](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html) in Kotlin.

Kotlin classes can be mixed in a project with existing Java code.
This might come handy when certain APIs require the use of mentioned Kotlin Coroutines.

### Adding Extensions

Likewise, it is possible to customize the behavior of internal classes in the IntelliJ Platform using [extensions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html).
For example, it is common practice to [guard logging statements](https://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#logging_performance) to avoid the cost of parameter construction, leading to the following ceremony when using the log:

```java
if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
  logger.debug("..." + expensiveComputation());
}
```

We can achieve the same result more succinctly in Kotlin, by declaring the following extension method:

```kotlin
inline fun Logger.debug(lazyMessage: () -> String) {
  if (isDebugEnabled) {
    debug(lazyMessage())
  }
}
```

Now we can directly write:

```kotlin
logger.debug { "..." + expensiveComputation() }
```

to receive all the benefits of lightweight logging while reducing the code verbosity.

With practice, you will be able to recognize many idioms in the IntelliJ Platform that can be simplified with Kotlin.

### UI Forms in Kotlin

The IntelliJ Platform provides a [type safe DSL](kotlin_ui_dsl_version_2.md) to build UI forms in a declarative way.

> Using _UI Designer_ plugin with Kotlin is [not supported](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KTIJ-791).
>

### Kotlin Coroutines

[](kotlin_coroutines.md) are a lightweight and easy to implement alternative to threads with many [advantages](kotlin_coroutines.md#coroutines-advantages).

## Adding Kotlin Support

> The [](plugin_github_template.md) provides a preconfigured project using Kotlin.

IntelliJ IDEA bundles the necessary Kotlin plugin, requiring no further configuration.
For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html).

### Kotlin Gradle Plugin

Adding Kotlin source files compilation support to the Gradle-based project requires adding and configuring the [Kotlin JVM Gradle plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle.html#targeting-the-jvm).

See the <path>build.gradle.kts</path> from [kotlin_demo](%gh-sdk-samples%/kotlin_demo) sample plugin:

```kotlin
```

{src="kotlin_demo/build.gradle.kts" include-lines="2-"}

### Kotlin Standard Library (stdlib)
{id="kotlin-standard-library"}

Since Kotlin 1.4, a dependency on the standard library _stdlib_ is added automatically ([API Docs](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/)).
In most cases, it is not necessary to include it in the plugin distribution as the platform already bundles it.

To opt out, add this line in <path>gradle.properties</path>:

```
kotlin.stdlib.default.dependency = false
```

The presence of this Gradle property is checked by the [](tools_gradle_intellij_plugin.md) with the [](tools_gradle_intellij_plugin.md#tasks-verifypluginconfiguration) task.
If the property is not present, a warning will be reported during the plugin configuration verification,
as it is a common problem when Kotlin _stdlib_ gets bundled within the plugin archive.
To bundle _stdlib_ in the plugin distribution, specify explicitly `kotlin.stdlib.default.dependency = true`.

If a plugin supports [multiple platform versions](build_number_ranges.md), it must either target the lowest bundled _stdlib_ version
or the specific version must be [provided in plugin distribution](plugin_content.md#plugin-with-dependencies).

### Kotlin Coroutines Libraries (kotlinx.coroutines)
{id="coroutinesLibraries"}

Plugins _must_ always use the bundled library from the target IDE and not bundle their own version.
Please make sure it is not added via transitive dependencies either
(see [View and Debug Dependencies](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/viewing_debugging_dependencies.html) in Gradle user guide).

See [](kotlin_coroutines.md) on how to use them in plugins.

| IntelliJ Platform version | Bundled _kotlinx-coroutines_ version |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 2024.1                    | 1.7.3                                |

### Other Bundled Kotlin Libraries

In general, it is strongly advised to always use the bundled library version.

Please see [Third-Party Software and Licenses](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/third-party-software/) for an overview of all bundled libraries.

### Incremental compilation

The Kotlin Gradle plugin supports [incremental compilation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle-compilation-and-caches.html#incremental-compilation), which allows tracking changes in the source files so the compiler handles only updated code.

<tabs>

<tab title="Kotlin 1.9.0 and later">

No action required.

Remove additional `kotlin.incremental.useClasspathSnapshot=false` property in <path>gradle.properties</path> if present.

</tab>

<tab title="Kotlin 1.8.20">

> Please consider using Kotlin 1.9.0 or later where this issue has been resolved.

Kotlin `1.8.20` has a [new incremental compilation approach](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle-compilation-and-caches.html#a-new-approach-to-incremental-compilation) which is enabled by default.
Unfortunately, it is not compatible with the IntelliJ Platform â€” when reading large JAR files (like <path>app.jar</path> or <path>3rd-party-rt.jar</path>),
leading to an `Out of Memory` exception:

```
Execution failed for task ':compileKotlin'.
> Failed to transform app.jar to match attributes {artifactType=classpath-entry-snapshot, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, org.gradle.usage=java-runtime}.
   > Execution failed for ClasspathEntrySnapshotTransform: .../lib/app.jar.
      > Java heap space
```

To avoid this exception, add the following line to <path>gradle.properties</path>:

```
kotlin.incremental.useClasspathSnapshot=false
```

</tab>
</tabs>

## Plugin Implementation Notes

### Do not use "object" but "class"

{id="object-vs-class"}

Plugins *may* use [Kotlin classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html) (`class` keyword) to implement declarations in the [plugin configuration file](plugin_configuration_file.md).
When registering an extension, the platform uses a dependency injection framework to instantiate these classes at runtime.
For this reason, plugins *must not* use [Kotlin objects](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html#object-declarations-overview) (`object` keyword) to implement any <path>[plugin.xml](plugin_configuration_file.md)</path> declarations.
Managing the lifecycle of extensions is the platform's responsibility and instantiating these classes as Kotlin singletons may cause issues.

A notable exception is `com.intellij.openapi.fileTypes.FileType` (`com.intellij.fileType` extension point), see also the inspection descriptions below.

Problems are highlighted via these inspections (2023.2):

- <control>Plugin DevKit | Code | Kotlin object registered as extension</control> for Kotlin code
- <control>Plugin DevKit | Plugin descriptor | Extension class is a Kotlin object</control> for <path>plugin.xml</path>

### Do not use "companion object" in extensions

{id="companion-object-extensions"}

Kotlin `companion object` is always created once you try to load its containing class, and [extension point implementations](plugin_extensions.md) are supposed to be cheap to create.
To avoid unnecessary classloading (and thus slowdown in IDE startup), `companion object` in extensions must only contain simple constants or [logger](ide_infrastructure.md#logging).
Anything else must be a top-level declaration or stored in an `object`.

Use inspection <control>Plugin DevKit | Code | Companion object in extensions</control> to highlight such problems (2023.3).
