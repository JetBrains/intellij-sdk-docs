## Define a Test Method
Add the `testCommenter()` method to the `SimpleCodeInsightTest` class [previously defined](completion_test.md#define-a-test).
This test constructs a Simple Language properties file containing one line, with the virtual caret positioned at the beginning of the line.
The test calls the commenter to insert a comment character at the caret, then verifies the results.
It again calls the line comment action to remove the comment character and verifies the results.

```java
```
{src="simple_language_plugin/src/test/java/org/intellij/sdk/language/SimpleCodeInsightTest.java" include-symbol="testCommenter"}

## Run the Test
[Run](parsing_test.md#run-the-test) the test and make sure it's green.
