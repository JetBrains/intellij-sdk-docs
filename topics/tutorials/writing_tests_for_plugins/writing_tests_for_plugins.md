This tutorial demonstrates how to write and run automated tests for a custom language plugin.

As an example, the plugin implemented in the [Custom Language Support Tutorial](custom_language_support_tutorial.md) is used to demonstrate functional test development.

The plugin and test code can be found in the [simple_language_plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-sdk-code-samples/tree/main/simple_language_plugin) code sample.
