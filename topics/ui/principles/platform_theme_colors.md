# Platform Theme Colors

<link-summary>Guidelines on working with themes.</link-summary>

There are two default color themes: IntelliJ Light and Darcula.

![](01_default_themes.png){width=689}

Use the colors consistently within the default themes. To do so, follow these guidelines:

* [Icons](icons.md)
* UI components
* Editor scheme TBD
* Chart TBD

## UI components

Colors for UI components are specified with **color keys**.
A color key is a name of a color property in a particular component, e.g. `ComboBox.background`, or a generic color property for several components, e.g. `Component.borderColor`.

*Color keys of a combo box*

Each key has two default color values: one for IntelliJ Light and another for Darcula. Example: `ComboBox.background` is #FFFFFF in IntelliJ Light and #3C3F41 in Darcula.

Keys allow creating [custom color themes](themes_getting_started.md). A custom theme is one of the default themes plus a set of color keys with new values in a JSON file. Example: the High contrast theme is a custom theme based on Darcula. New color values are stored in the [`HighContrast.theme.json`](%gh-ic%/platform/platform-resources/src/themes/HighContrast.theme.json) JSON file.

See custom themes in the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?tags=Theme">plugins repository</a>.

See the meanings of the parts in a color key in the [key naming scheme](themes_metadata.md#key-naming-scheme).

See a complete list of keys with their descriptions in the JSON files: [`IntelliJPlatform.themeMetadata.json`](%gh-ic%/platform/platform-resources/src/themes/metadata/IntelliJPlatform.themeMetadata.json), [`JDK.themeMetadata.json`](%gh-ic%/platform/platform-resources/src/themes/metadata/JDK.themeMetadata.json).

See the color values for the currently selected theme in the <control>LaF Defaults</control> dialog:

> To store color values between theme switching, use a scratch <path>*.theme.json</path> file.
> This might be useful if you want to test colors before implementing them.
> See guidelines for the [Theme JSON Structure](themes_customize.md#defining-named-colors).

* The dialog is available in the [internal mode](enabling_internal.md). See <ui-path>Tools | Internal Actions | UI</ui-path> in the main menu or find it with <control>Help | Find Action</control>.
* Some color keys are not shown in the dialog by default because they are loaded at runtime with a corresponding UI component. Open the UI with this component to see such keys in the dialog.
* Edit a color in the dialog to preview it in the IDE. The edited color is stored until the theme is switched.

> For IntelliJ designers:
> * Provide color keys in design specifications to be sure that correct keys are used.
> * When a new key is implemented, check that [`IntelliJPlatform.themeMetadata.json`](%gh-ic%/platform/platform-resources/src/themes/metadata/IntelliJPlatform.themeMetadata.json) has the new key with the `since` parameter and description, and the old keys are deprecated.

If a color is needed:

1. Choose a color value for all default themes:

* Try reusing any of the existing colors first. Use the LaF Defaults dialog to see the existing colors.
* If none of them fit, choose two new color values that are consistent with IntelliJ Light and Darcula palettes in hue and contrast.

2. Choose a color key if a component does not have it:

* Use an existing color key if it fits semantically. Otherwise, a UI component might get an unexpected color in a custom color theme.
* Create a new key if none of the existing ones fit semantically. Follow the naming scheme.

**Example**

<format color="Red" style="bold">Incorrect:</format> A new component with a light-blue background reuses Focus.borderColor which has a light-blue color in the default themes. A theme author decides they need a bright focus border and changes the color value for Focus.borderColor. As a result, the new component has a bright background with the text unreadable over it.

<format color="Green" style="bold">Correct:</format> A new component with a light-blue background has its own color key <code>ComponentName.background</code>.


**Implementation**
Use `JBColor.namedColor` to set a color key and fallback color values:

<tabs group="languages">
<tab title="Kotlin" group-key="kotlin">

```kotlin
val SELECTED_BACKGROUND_COLOR: Color =
    JBColor.namedColor(
        "CompletionPopup.selectionBackground",
        JBColor(0xc5dffc, 0x113a5c)
    )
```

</tab>
<tab title="Java" group-key="java">

```java
private static final Color SELECTED_BACKGROUND_COLOR =
    JBColor.namedColor(
        "CompletionPopup.selectionBackground",
        new JBColor(0xc5dffc, 0x113a5c)
    );
```

</tab>
</tabs>
